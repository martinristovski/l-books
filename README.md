NB. Some of our tests and user stories relate to features we intend to implement in iter2.

In order to run the project locally, you would need to set up a postgresql server first. To run the tests, use `rake spec` and `rake cucumber`. A demo is available on heroku at the link above, and a coverage report of our tests is available in `public/coverage/index.html`.
